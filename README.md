My opinion Essay On A WAM Topic
My Opinion Essay On A WAM Topic
During the WAM program. From March 1 to March 21, a lot of interesting
topics were touched upon. Efforts and care have been invested in the creation of
the program. The events clearly show fresh perspectives on contemporary topics.
After the program, I became more aware of these topics, and strengthened
my knowledge in understanding the technological world around me. I must say
right away that it was not easy to attend every event. This required constant
discipline. A large number of technical terms complicated this task. These terms
are not clear to a creative person. But I tried very hard, and in the end it became
more clear to me. I am very glad that I took part in this program!
All topics raised in the program are very well chosen. The combination of
novelty and the right time is perfect. All these topics require more in-depth study
and development. I watched some online broadcasts several times.
Therefore, they need to be covered more often in the media, and marketing
should be used. This will help attract human capital to research these topics. I am
sure that these topics are the future!!! What is interesting is that all the topics are
chosen carelessly, are interconnected and complement each other. I am grateful to
the organizers that they gathered them in a place and are engaged in educational
activities.
Empowering digital freedom and restoring privacy.
First, I would like to note whether it is possible to talk about “digital
surveillance” of the government with financial, ideological and technological
support from non-democratic partner states or the possibility of controlling
personal data and protecting it from unauthorized or illegal processing, storage,
destruction or damage to this information? How to find a golden mean and balance
in matters of ensuring cybersecurity for society, on the one hand, and, on the other
hand, respect rights and freedoms both offline and online? And the state is
constantly trying to regulate this area from the point of view of public
administration. And we must find a balance and a solution to this. This is
especially important to ensure a sustainable information and cyber security
ecosystem as a whole.
Web3 and NFT in the music industry
Speaking about Web3, I would like to note the main problems:
• It is inconvenient for people to run their servers
• Protocols have always evolved slower than platforms
• Vulnerabilities in the work of distributed applications - this can carry risks
for customers
• Many elements of DAO infrastructures are in fact centralized, and this
makes me laugh
• Perhaps we are still at the very beginning, but huge resources are already
pouring into this area, such as (creativity, intelligence, finance…)
The main thing that I want to understand is whether all this will lead to a
useful result for our society.
It's probably too early to tell, but it's surprising that web3 doesn't involve
much cryptography! I also wanted to add that the use of Artificial Intelligence will
help simplify software development and help the development of Web3.
As for NFTs in the music industry, there are already changes happening in
the music industry. NFTs give creators and music creatives new sources of income
and full control over their digital assets. It also saves you from intermediaries and
unnecessary expenses !!! This is especially important in my opinion.
The main thing to understand is that when buying musical NFTs, people do
not acquire the rights to audio or composition, but pay for the virtual right to brag
and the opportunity to support the performers. And it could fundamentally change
the streaming service, as well as video blogging and filmmaking. Separately, you
can talk about the release of tracks in the metasettlement))))
Art, blockchain and NFT
All these are the engines of progress, and they radically change our time!
Digital art that uses blockchain technology. Blockchain helps digital artists solve
the problem of free replication by releasing a limited number of items and tying
them to unique tokens that prove ownership.
Now a remarkably interesting period has come. Crypto millionaires who
previously shopped for fun saw that there was a market for art. In 2021, artists
from the traditional agenda entered the NFT market and started making digital art.
Behind them are "traditional" collectors. The artists who made their presence
known in the first wave are developing a new direction in storytelling, cinema,
special effects, and the gaming industry. Of course, the problem is that not all
artists in the NFT market create art. And there are many speculators. However,
everything that happens before our eyes will have a positive impact on art. I think
in the future there will be authors with a deeper content of the work. The market
will only grow.
DAO
I met DAO a couple of weeks before the program. This is a completely new
and incredibly flexible way to organize everything around. Here you can highlight
certain issues for discussion for specific groups of people and get a decision faster.
I am very interested in code management and collective management after a
while. I wonder what methods and methods will appear, and how they will affect
the world around us.
What could be better
More activities, different creative tasks for ordinary listeners. Create specific
guides. So that listeners can try the material they listened to in practice. Listeners
would get their own experience in the topic that interested them. And it is possible
to move further in the chosen direction. And the most talented can be attracted for
cooperation.
PS. Do another hackathon like this.
